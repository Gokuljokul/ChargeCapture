# React-Native-PictureOCR
Combine Charge-capture-Camere and Charge-capture-Text-Detector for picture OCR 
can detect photo's word as seperate lines from gallery or camera.

Recommend using camera from the apps instead of Built-in for higher precision of picture

After you start the app click Charge-capture-Detector OCR, then choose the picture or using camera to take one that you want to detect.
Then you'll see the result of it, click on an orange box can add it's text into Array.
